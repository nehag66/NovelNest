		Are you a college going student and are upset with the increasing number
		of used books after each new semester, or you are a regular book reader
		who after reading the books, keep the old books on the bookshelves or in
		a cupboard and forget them? If yes, then Novel Nest is just made for
		you! <br />
		Novel Nest is India's leading platform where you can sell used books
		online. At Novel Nest, we help people to sell their used books to
		another book lover just like them at interesting prices. <br />
		Selling and buying books on Novel Nest is a win-win situation for both
		the buyer and the seller. How? Let's see. As a seller, you can earn some
		good amount of money by selling your old books (which you don't even
		need) to another person at good prices. And being a buyer, you can save
		some money by buying the second hand books directly from the book owner.

		<i class="fw-bold">"Selling used second hand books at your own desired price is not an
		uphill battle anymore. Just sell them on Novel Nest!"</i>
